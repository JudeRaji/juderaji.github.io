									</header>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/udemy_courses/udemy_dashboard.png" alt="" /></span>

									<h3>Introduction:</h3>
									<p>In an era where digital education is a keystone for growth and innovation, data stands as the beacon guiding the way. 
										I, Jude Raji, a data analyst with a zeal for educational trends, embarked on a project to unravel the story told by Udemy's wealth of course data. 
										This was a journey into the heart of online learning, seeking to extract the narratives woven within the numbers of enrollments, revenues, and course popularity.</p>
										<p>The mission was to crystallize raw data into strategic insights, illuminating which courses kindled the most curiosity and which formats held learners' attention. 
										This exploration was more than a study—it was a map to empower one of the largest learning platforms in navigating the tides 
										of digital education and curating an experience that resonates with learners worldwide.</p>
									<hr class="major" />
									<h3>Problem Statement:</h3>
									<p>As Udemy's repository of courses grows exponentially, so does the challenge of understanding what drives learner engagement and course profitability. 
										With a vast array of subjects, formats, and pricing options, identifying the key factors that contribute to a course's success is not only crucial 
										for content creators but also for the strategic direction of the platform. 
										This project aimed to tackle the pressing question: what patterns and trends in the data can inform Udemy's approach to maximize both 
										learner satisfaction and revenue generation in the competitive landscape of online education?</p>

									<hr class="major" />
									<h3>Task:</h3>
									<p>Complete an Exploratory Data Analysis of Udemy's courses with the following outputs:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Identify trends in course enrollment and categorize the most popular subjects.</li>
										<li>Assess the correlation between course price, ratings, and enrollment numbers.</li>
										<li>Determine the distribution of course levels (beginner, intermediate, expert) across various subjects.</li>
										<li>Analyze the revenue generation over time to pinpoint peak performance periods.</li>
										<li>Evaluate the impact of course duration on subscriber count and satisfaction.</li>
										<li>Create an extensive dashboard to present to stakeholders.</li>
										<li>Generate a report summarizing the key findings and potential areas for strategic improvement.</li>
									</ul>

									<h3>The Analytical Approach:</h3>
									<p>The journey began with root cause analysis (RCA), a methodical approach to uncover the underlying reasons for the variations in donation figures across different regions.
										Employing the Five Whys technique, I was able to delve into the data and question each finding to reach the core issues that affect fundraising outcomes.</p>
	
									<h3>Data cleaning:</h3>
									<p>Before diving deep into analysis, the dataset underwent a rigorous cleaning process to ensure the integrity and clarity of the insights. This involved:</p>
										<ol>
											<li><b>Removing Duplicates</b>: Ensuring no donor was counted more than once.</li>
											<li><b>Addressing Missing Values</b>: Filling or removing gaps (or null values) in the data where necessary.</li>
											<li><b>Normalizing Data</b>: Adjusting numerical values for comparability, crucial for analysis.</li>
											<li><b>Correcting Errors</b>: Amending typos and inaccuracies in state names, job field, and other categorical data.</li>
											<li><b>Consolidating Data</b>: Merging both (donation and donor) tables while avoiding redundancy.</li>
											<li><b>Anonymizing Data</b>: Protecting donor privacy by anonymizing personal information where required.</li>
											<li><b>Pruning Irrelevant Data</b>: Removing non-essential data fields for a focused analysis.</li>
											<li><b>Sorting and Filtering</b>: Arranging the data for optimal analysis and filtering out the noise.</li>
											<li><b>Verifying Accuracy</b>: Ensuring the dataset’s reflections of real-world entities post-cleaning.</li>
										</ol>
									<p>With a clean and reliable dataset, the stage was set for deeper analysis and visualization.</p>
