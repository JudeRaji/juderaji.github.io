								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/tesla_sales/tesla_home.png" alt="Tesla Home Image" /></div>
								<h3>Purpose:</h3>
								<p>The aim of this project is to analyze Tesla's multifaceted performance from 2019 to 2023, utilizing data from production, workforce expansion, 
									financial results, and global factory locations. The intent is to provide investors and company stakeholders with clear insights into 
									Tesla's operational efficiency, market growth, and financial health, to support informed decisions regarding future investments and 
									strategic directions within the electric vehicle market. This analysis will spotlight key areas of success and potential growth, 
									guiding focused investment strategies in the evolving automotive landscape.</p>
									
								<h3>Methodology and Data Structures:</h3>
								<p>This analysis was meticulously conducted by sourcing data directly from <a href="https://ir.tesla.com">Tesla's Investor Relations website</a>, 
									where official quarterly reports from 2019 to 2023 were made publicly available. 
									A total of 20 PDF files were methodically reviewed and extracted.</p>
									<p>To manage and transform this extensive dataset, we employed Power Query, a powerful ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tool that streamlined 
									the consolidation and cleaning process. Power Query enabled the extraction of relevant figures and narratives from the reports, 
									transforming them into a structured format suitable for analysis. The processed data was then utilized to craft the comprehensive 
									KPI dashboard that serves as the backbone of this report, ensuring the findings are both reliable and actionable.</p>
								
								<h3>Key Discoveries and Insights:</h3>
								<p>A look through Tesla's recent history from 2019 to 2023 reveals some compelling narratives about its growth:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Vehicle Output</b>: Tesla has impressively rolled out over 5 million vehicles and nearly matched this in deliveries, 
										painting a picture of a company adeptly meeting its customers’ needs and navigating the logistics of supply and demand.

										<li><b>Enhance Workforce Development</b>: Focus on talent cultivation and retention to support the increased scale of operations, 
											ensuring that workforce growth contributes effectively to company goals.</li>
										<li><b>Refine Pricing and Cost Management</b>: With a healthy financial standing, Tesla should continually assess and adjust its 
											pricing strategy to remain competitive while also looking for new ways to optimize costs and enhance profitability.</li>
